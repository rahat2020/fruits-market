Hello guy's!! welcome to my full stack client and server project. In this project I' used react to create react app to do this project.
I have added so many features in this project. I had added react bootstrap navigation bar, Card so on and also hugely used bootstrap and react bootstrap and material ui framework in this project as well.

What are the features that i had added...
1) Google authentication.
2) I did private route to protect the others components or url--
    like- if you are not a logged in or signed in user then you may can't enter the other components or URL.

3) If you clicked on buy now then it will take you to login page. After signing you can order the items.
4) In this project i didn't create any fakeData rather i used dynamic data and save it to the server in mongodb. I created API to call the data from the mongodb.
5) I deploy my mongodb data to the https://heroku.com.
6) Here i created addProduct components where if you are a logged in user you can add more data to the server and UI.
7) Here i also created a ADMIN components  where you can delete or manage the data.

finally, If the URL don't work properly reload it or hard reload and also hard cache reload it.


Thank you for reading this Intro.
